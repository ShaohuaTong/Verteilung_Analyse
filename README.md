# Verteilung_Analyse
This is an Assist with mathematics teaching aids for a professor under Hochschule Emden/leer.

# Introduction
1. Primarily used to develop graphs of various probability distributions with different parameter inputs and to calculate probability densities and cumulative distributions for specific ranges. 
2. Develops graphs of higher polynomial functions and fractional functions and calculates their special points.

# Rquirement
Requires pyqt5 to run code, Recommended installation of pyqt5 via anaconda.

Once installed, you can simply open the run.exe file in the dist folder.


# Evaluation
Due to the author's own technical skills and not understanding  the convenience of gitnore files at the time, this library uploads a lot of files that are not necessary to upload. Sorry to anyone who sees this library here.

The most critical parts of the library are in the funtion folder, with three python file for binomial funtion, hypergeometric funtion and normal funtion. Finally the python files are packaged as exe files using Pycharm. They are stored in the Dist folder.
